http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_by_IATA_code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Geo::IATA;
    $g = Geo::IATA->new;
    
    print $g->icao2iata("EDDB");          # SXF
    print $g->iata2icao("SXF");           # EDDB
    print $g->iata2airport("SXF");        # Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport
    print $g->iata("SXF")->[0]{airport};  # same but with full resultset

    print map{$_->{airport}} @{$g->airport("A%")}; # all airport names starting with A

    print $g->icao("EDDB")->[0]{iata};    # SXF

    print map {$_->{iata} } @{$g->location("%France")};  # iata code for french airports
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a SQLite DB for airport data. Searchable information are IATA,ICAO
data airport name and location.

=head1 INTERFACE

Geo::IATA is a pure oo module.

=head2 new

Constructor. A connection to internal SQLite DB is opened.
You can optional specify the path to the sqlite database.
The sqlite db default location is dirname($INC{Geo/IATA.pm})/IATA/iata_sqlite.db

=cut

=head2 dbh

Gets the dbh to internal sqlite database.

=head2 iata

=head2 icao

=head2 airport

=head2 location

Input: iata, icao code, airport name or location. May use SQL wildcards.

Returns an arrayref of hashrefs of all matched rows for the query 

select * from table where <field> like <arg>

[{iata => IATA,icao => ICAO, airport => AIRPORT,location => LOCATION}]

=head2 (iata|icao|airport|location)2(iata|icao|airport|location)

Simple from2to mapping methods. On multiple matches the first one is taken.
Warning some iata codes have no mapping to icao code in wikipedia.

=cut

=head2 AUTOLOAD

The module uses AUTOLOAD to call above queries.

=cut

=head2 DESTROY

Closes internal dbi connection to sqlite db.

=cut

=head1 UPDATE AIRPORT CODES


You can manually update the airport codes from wikipedia with the script

create/iata_wikipedia.pl
